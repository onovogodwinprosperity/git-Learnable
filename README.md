## Version Control  
Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time, allowing you to collaborate, manage versions, and revert to earlier versions if necessary.  

## Difference Between Git and GitHub  
- **Git**: A distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and allows for collaboration. It is a command-line tool.  
- **GitHub**: A platform for hosting Git repositories, providing additional features like pull requests, issues, and collaborative tools.  

## GitHub Alternatives  
1. GitLab  
2. Bitbucket  
3. SourceForge  

## Git Fetch vs Git Pull  
- **Git Fetch**: Downloads changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your working branch.  
- **Git Pull**: Downloads changes and merges them directly into your working branch.  

## Git Rebase  
**Simple Explanation**: Git rebase moves or applies your commits onto another branch, creating a linear commit history.  
**Command**:  
```bash
git rebase <branch>
